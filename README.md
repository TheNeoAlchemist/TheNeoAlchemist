üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Daniel Carroll, known on Github as "TheNeoAlchemist," and I'm developing tools that empower scientists to carry out research more effectively. With a background in electrochemical biosensor development and a keen interest in practical software solutions, I‚Äôm currently creating The Chemist's Toolbox, a comprehensive software suite tailored for research labs. This user-friendly application is designed to simplify complex lab calculations, eliminate errors, and streamline tasks, making it a valuable asset for anyone from interns to seasoned research scientists.

The Chemist's Toolbox brings together tools that solve common lab challenges, aiming to minimise human error. This is especially important in collaborative settings where scientists come from various backgrounds and may have differing levels of proficiency. The Toolbox prevents inaccuracies, allowing users to focus on high-impact experimental design rather than manual number-crunching.

Each feature in The Chemist's Toolbox has been thoughtfully developed to be accessible, with a clean, intuitive interface and a detailed user manual in straightforward english.

I‚Äôm excited to release this resource to the scientific community within the next 12 months. If you have suggestions tools or functionalities you‚Äôd like to see in The Chemist's Toolbox, or if you‚Äôre interested in getting early access to the software before the official release, please reach out. Together, we can shape a Toolbox that serves your unique lab needs and fosters innovation in research.

Above you can see three examples of tools which will be included in the final software package.

Concentration Calculator
-
The Concentration Calculator offers two powerful to simplify solution preparation. In the first mode, you can calculate the final concentration of a mixture when combining solutions. For instance, if you need a final concentration of 0.5 M when mixing two solutions, the calculator performs all the conversions, even allowing you to switch between molarity, ppt, ppb, or ppm if you provide the molecular weight. It also features real-time tracking, so as you adjust concentrations, a dynamically updated table and bar graph show how the overall concentration and volume of the solution change with each addition‚Äîperfect for titrations, biosensing applications or fine-tuning calibration solutions.

In the second mode, the Concentration Calculator determines the exact mass required to reach a target concentration and volume. For example, if you're preparing a 100 mL solution of 0.2 M sodium chloride, just enter your desired concentration, and it calculates the required mass, helping you avoid errors that arise from manual conversions.

Dilution Calculator
-
The Dilution Calculator has both forward and reverse modes designed to streamline dilution calculations, ideal for preparing solutions across multiple concentrations or volumes. The forward mode enables you to input stock solutions (up to five) and the desired concentrations and volumes for up to ten different dilutions. This setup can be incredibly useful in generating a series of standards for a calibration curve, where the tool calculates the exact volumes of stock and buffer required, ensuring precision across your dilutions.

In reverse mode, the tool is designed to be smart: it automatically recommends the best combination of stocks to create the desired concentrations, avoiding pipetting volumes under 1 ¬µL to maintain accuracy.

Molecular Weight Calculator
-
The Molecular Weight Calculator is designed to help with compound characterisation and solution preparation. You can name the compound (customised for each user or experiment) and input the molecular formula in any format‚Äîas long as the elements are capitalised correctly, the calculator recognises and calculates the molecular weight and displays the elemental composition in a table format. This flexibility saves time and reduces errors for users unfamiliar with complex formulas. For instance, inputting ‚ÄúC6H12O6‚Äù yields the molecular weight and a breakdown of each element‚Äôs contribution, an ideal reference for creating stoichiometric calculations or solution recipes.
